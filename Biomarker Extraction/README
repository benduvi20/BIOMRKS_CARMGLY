CONTEXT: 
This folder contains code to train and use RCNN segmentation and detection
models to extract cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) and cardiopulmonary area ratio
(CPAR) of posterior-anterior chest X-ray samples in MIMIC-CXR-JPG. CTR and CPAR
values can then be used to classify cardiomegaly samples. 

Different ensemble models (detection prioritised, segmentation prioritised, best
score ensemble, average ensemble) are avalible when retreiving CTR values. CPAR
values can only be obtained via a segmentaiton only set of models.   

These scrpits use 3 sources of medical imaging databases: MIMIC-CXR-JPG,
Japanese scociety of radiological technology (JSRT), Montgomery Tuberculosis
(MGMY). These images are paired with lung and heart segmentaion masks. For
MIMIC-CXR-JPG - 200 segmentation masks are avalible on PhysioNet in an
assocaited datapaper (); for JSRT - segmentations are included in database; for
MGMY - lung segmentation are avalible in teh Segmentation of Chest radiographs
(SCR) database, heart segmentation are avalible with IMC segmentations. Links
avalible below.
